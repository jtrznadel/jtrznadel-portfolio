      "Hello, I'm Jakub and I am currently in my first year of pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow. \n \n My journey into the world of mobile and web development started with a fascination for creating interactive and beautiful applications. Over time, I've honed my skills in Flutter and Swift, building responsive and engaging user interfaces. My passion for coding goes beyond the classroom. I've worked on a variety of projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge and creativity. I'm always on the lookout for exciting challenges and opportunities to collaborate with others in the tech world. \n \n When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, working on building both my body and mind, or exploring the picturesque mountain paths, seeking new perspectives and adventures. I'm passionate about pushing boundaries and embracing challenges, both in the tech world and in the great outdoors. \n \n My aim is to gain my initial commercial experience in this field and pursue further education. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my latest work and get in touch if you'd like to connect or collaborate.";
